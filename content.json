A good data preprocessing can greatly improve the performence of the models. One another hand, if data is not prepared properly then the result of any model could be just “Garbage in Garbage out”. Below are the typical steps to process a dataset: Load the dataset, in order to get a sense of the data Taking care of missing data (Optional) Encoding categorical data (Optional) Splitting dataset into the Training set and Test set (Validation set) Feature Scaling Thanks for all the powerful libararies, today we can implement above steps very easily with Python. Import the libararies123import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport pandas as pd numpy is a popular libaray for sintific computing. Here will mainly use it’s N-dimensional array object. It also has very useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities matploylib is a Python 2D plotting library which can help us to visulize the dataset pandas is a easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. We use it to load and separat datasets. sklearn is another libaray we will use later. It is a very powerful tool for data analysis. Due to its comprehensive tools we will introduce them indivdualy once we use them.

One is the age of customer 6. Another is the salary of customer 4. Most of the time we need to fullfill the missing values to make the model work. There are three main ways to do it. Using the ‘mean’, ‘median’ or ‘most frequent’. Here I will implement by using the meam of each value. 12345678910# Import the sklearn libararyfrom sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer# Instanciate the Imputer class# misstion_value: the place holder for the missting value, here use the default 'NaN'# strategy: 'mean', 'median' and 'most_frequent'# aixs: 0 - impute along columns. 1 - impute along rows.imputer = Imputer(missing_values = 'NaN', strategy = 'mean', axis = 0)# Fit column Age and Salaryimputer = imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3])X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3]) 12# value of Xprint(X) [[&apos;France&apos; 44.0 72000.0] [&apos;Spain&apos; 27.0 48000.0] [&apos;Germany&apos; 30.0 54000.0] [&apos;Spain&apos; 38.0 61000.0] [&apos;Germany&apos; 40.0 63777.77777777778] [&apos;France&apos; 35.0 58000.0] [&apos;Spain&apos; 38.77777777777778 52000.0] [&apos;France&apos; 48.0 79000.0] [&apos;Germany&apos; 50.0 83000.0] [&apos;France&apos; 37.0 67000.0]] Here we used sklearn’s Imputer module to help us to take care of the missing data. From the code you can see it become very easy by using the libaray. And the missing Age and Salary are filled with the mean value of their column. Encoding Categorical DataIn our dataset, the first column is contry name. The values in this column are text not numbers. But the machine learning model only work with numbers. So we need to encode the country name into numbers. 12345678# Import LabelEncoder to encode text into numbersfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder# Encode first column of XlabelEncoder_X = LabelEncoder()X[:, 0] = labelEncoder_X.fit_transform(X[:, 0])# print value of Xprint(X) [[0 44.0 72000.0] [2 27.0 48000.0] [1 30.0 54000.0] [2 38.0 61000.0] [1 40.0 63777.77777777778] [0 35.0 58000.0] [2 38.77777777777778 52000.0] [0 48.0 79000.0] [1 50.0 83000.0] [0 37.0 67000.0]] After using LabelEncoder, you can see we encode the country names from text into numbers. Here we got ‘France’ -&gt; 0, ‘Germany’ -&gt; 1, ‘Spain’ -&gt; 2. All good, right? NO! Here’s the problem, by encoding ‘France’, ‘Germany’ and ‘Spain’ into 0, 1 and 2, it means ‘Spain’ is greater than ‘Germany’, and ‘Germany’ is greater than ‘France’, just like 2 &gt; 1 &gt;0. This is wrong and all the countries should be considered on the same level. So we need to do some extra work to correct this result. 1234567891011# Import OneHotEncoder modulefrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder# Instantiate OneHotEncoder and set the first column oneHotEncoder = OneHotEncoder(categorical_features = [0])# Encoder the first column of X and return an array objectX = oneHotEncoder.fit_transform(X).toarray()# print value of Xfloat_formatter = lambda x: \"%.2f\" % xnp.set_printoptions(formatter = &#123;'float_kind' : float_formatter&#125;)print(X) [[1.00 0.00 0.00 44.00 72000.00] [0.00 0.00 1.00 27.00 48000.00] [0.00 1.00 0.00 30.00 54000.00] [0.00 0.00 1.00 38.00 61000.00] [0.00 1.00 0.00 40.00 63777.78] [1.00 0.00 0.00 35.00 58000.00] [0.00 0.00 1.00 38.78 52000.00] [1.00 0.00 0.00 48.00 79000.00] [0.00 1.00 0.00 50.00 83000.00] [1.00 0.00 0.00 37.00 67000.00]] After the categorical encoding, the first column of X is separated into three columns. Each column represent one country. By doing this the model will know which country the customer comes from and make sure the model treat all the country at the same level. Now let’s encode y as well. 1234567891011# before encodingprint('Before encoding: ')print(y)# Since y only has two values, 'yes' and 'no', we can just simply encode the value to 1 and 0 labelEncoder_y = LabelEncoder()y = labelEncoder_y.fit_transform(y)# print yprint('After encoding: ')print(y) Before encoding: [&apos;No&apos; &apos;Yes&apos; &apos;No&apos; &apos;No&apos; &apos;Yes&apos; &apos;Yes&apos; &apos;No&apos; &apos;Yes&apos; &apos;No&apos; &apos;Yes&apos;] After encoding: [0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1] Splitting the data set into the Training set and Test setOne thing that every machine learning process will do is to split dataset into Training set and Test set. Just like human, if the machine keep learning the same dataset, it could “learning it by heart”. Which means that the model could perform very accurate prediction on the same dataset, but when given a new dataset it model just performs poorly. We call this kind of scenario “overfitting”. As a result, to avoid this situation we’d like to separate the dataset into Training set which will be used for training the model. And Test set, which test if the model’s performance. If the model performs poorly on the Test set then we can try to correct the settings in the model and retry it. In some cases, people even break the dataset into three portions, training set, test set and validation set. So after trained and tested, validation set can be used to verify the final performance of the model. And this method to validate the model called cross validation. 1234567891011121314151617181920# Import 'train_test_split', a very self explaining module# Please notice the libaray we use is 'model_selection' from 'sklearn'from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split# Split X into X_train and X_test.

What it dose is to scale the values in a dataset into a range of -1 ~ 1. To do this has two benefits, firt the computation time is shorter with small scale numbers. Second, is to avoid a certain feature dominate the result due to a bigger scale. For example, in our dataset there are Age and Salary features. The values of Salary are much bigger than Age, so during the training process Salary feature has a chance to dominate the result and make Age feature become useless. So by scale them into the same level, we can avoid this problem to happen. There are two main ways to scale the feature: Standardization and Normalization. Standardization: $$x’ = \\frac{x - mean(X)}{standard-deviation-(x)}$$ Normalization : $$x’ = \\frac{x - mean(x)}{max(x) - min(x)}$$ 123456789101112# Here I use Standardizationfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalersc_X = StandardScaler()X_train[:, 3:5] = sc_X.fit_transform(X_train[:, 3:5])X_test[:, 3:5] = sc_X.transform(X_test[:, 3:5])# Print out X_train, X_testprint('X_train: ')print(X_train)print()print('X_test: ')print(X_test) X_train: [[0.00 1.00 0.00 0.26 0.12] [1.00 0.00 0.00 -0.25 0.46] [0.00 0.00 1.00 -1.98 -1.53] [0.00 0.00 1.00 0.05 -1.11] [1.00 0.00 0.00 1.64 1.72] [0.00 0.00 1.00 -0.08 -0.17] [1.00 0.00 0.00 0.95 0.99] [1.00 0.00 0.00 -0.60 -0.48]] X_test: [[0.00 1.00 0.00 -1.46 -0.90] [0.00 1.00 0.00 1.98 2.14]] Now we have all the step implemented for data preprocessing. In practice, not all the steps are needed. Please select the required steps based on your dataset.

Today I finally find sometime setting up this new blog site that has a nice looking theme. Now I am feeling so existed to start the new blogging journey!! As the first post, let’s talk a little about how I create this blog site. Hexo - Blog FrameworkHexo is a NodeJS based blog framework. \bThe set up is very easy, the only two things you need are NodeJS and Git. Once you have it installed and initialized, you can start blogging right away. Hexo is a complete package by itself. All the posts are writen by MarkDown (*.md) files, and later Hexo will traslate them into static HTML files during the process of pulishing. The vanilla Hexo already has Post, Archive, Categorize and Tags fundctions. By installing themes on Hexo you could also get Searching and Comment widgets. Hexo also has plugins like Google Analytics, Swiftype, Disqus e.g. So you would get anything you need to start a blog with Hexo. The best thing is all the plugins and widgets above are easyly configured in one _config.yml file. No code writing at all! Useful Links Hexo Doc Hexo Theme Hosting the blog on GitHub PageI hosted my blog site by using GutHut \bPages. It is a free and easy way to host a web application. Hexo has a deploy plugin for automatically deploy the blog onto GitHub. Details please check out the deployment section of Hexo Doc. Below are the links I found are very helpful: GitHub Pages How to setup a blog on github with Hexo Setting up a custom domain Tips: GitHub Pages requires you to create a repository with name like {username}.github.io, username is your GitHub username. Once you have the repositoy created, please DO NOT try to push all the Hexo source code into that repo. How Hexo works is that it will generate static web content based on the local source code and then push only the static content to the repo. And GitHub will scan the repo and set up a host for it. So after you create the repository please leave it empty, and then follow the document to configue the _config.yml file. After that just execute the command below Hexo will handle everything for you. After the command is done you should see that static contents are pushed into your repository.1$ hexo deploy Here is the link to my old blogs Old blogs","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://github.com/jwlbjtu/jwlbjtu.github.io/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"other","slug":"other","permalink":"https://github.com/jwlbjtu/jwlbjtu.github.io/tags/other/"}]}]}
